# mp4_boxes
In this exercise, a C++ application should be written that prints the layout of the sample file and extracts the content of the MDAT box.

Bonus 1: If MDAT box is very large, we might run out of memory.  
Bonus 2: If you provide a **-png** switch with `text0.mp4` file, you should get `image001.png`, `image002.png` and `image003.png`

#### How to build
##### Linux
 - create a 'build' directory in the same directory where `CMakeLists.txt` file is: `mkdir build`
 - type `cd build`, followed with `cmake ..` and then type `make`

##### Windows

One option is to:
 - create a 'build' directory in the same directory where `CMakeLists.txt` file is: `mkdir build`
 - type `cd build`, followed with `cmake ..` and then open VS solution generated by cmake
 
Another option is to start VS, go to `File` menu, select `Open` -> `Folder` and select directory with `CMakeLists.txt`

##### Mac
Don't have one.<br><br><br>

P.S.  
This was a coding challenge given to me for a C++ position in CastLabs (castlabs.com). For a detailed description see doc/coding_challenge.pdf  
The solution I provided here was not accepted. So, if you are targeting the same C++ position, you should provide a different (better) solution.
