# mp4_boxes
In this exercise, a C++ application should be written that prints the layout of the sample file and extracts the content of the MDAT box.

Bonus 1: If MDAT box is very large, we might run out of memory.  
Bonus 2: If you provide a **-png** switch with `text0.mp4` file, you should get `image001.png`, `image002.png` and `image003.png`
